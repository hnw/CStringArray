# CStringArray

CStringArray is an array of C-style strings for easier interoperability written in Swift.

This is a modified version of [the CStringArray by @neilpa](https://gist.github.com/neilpa/b430d148d1c5f4ae5ddd).

Modifications:

- Changed the constructor arguments to `[String?]`

- Be "printable"


## Install with Carthage

You can use [Carthage](https://github.com/Carthage/Carthage) to install CStringArray by adding it to your `Cartfile`:

```
github "hnw/CStringArray"
```

Then run `carthage update`.
